**Github Branch Error**
```console
! [remote rejected] main -> main (failure) error: failed to push some refs to
```
Solution: 
When you encounter this issue, it means that the ***head*** of your local repository is at a different point in the code timeline than the ***head*** of the origin repository. Git cannot handle this situation automatically. It occurs when the origin repository has progressed ahead of your local repository. To resolve this issue, you need to run the git pull command on your local repository. This command will merge the latest changes from the origin repository into your local repository and allow you to push your changes to the origin repository again.
```console
git pull origin [your-branch]
git push origin [your-branch]
```
