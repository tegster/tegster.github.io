# HTML and why HTML?

HTML serves as the foundation for all web pages and is typically the first language learned by developers, designers, and marketers. It's an essential component of front-end development work, providing structure to website content, including text, images, and videos. If you're new to coding, the possibilities of what you can create with HTML are exciting.

## HyperText Markup Language, or HTML 
is a type of markup language that defines the structure and presentation of raw text. HTML elements wrap raw text, which a computer can interpret. If you right-click on a web page and choose "Inspect," you'll see HTML code displayed in a panel on your screen. HyperText refers to text displayed on a computer or device that provides access to other text through hyperlinks, which you've probably clicked on to get to this Page

## Using the `input()` function to read user input as a string:

```python
print('Enter your name:')
x = input()
print('Hello, ' + x)
```
## Prompting the user for specific input:

```python
age = input("Enter your age: ")
print("Your age is " + age)
```

# Changing Input Data Type
## Type Conversion
## Converting a string input to an integer:

```python
num_str = input("Enter a number: ")
num = int(num_str)
print("The number is " + str(num))
```

## Converting a string input to a float:
```python
num_str = input("Enter a number: ")
num = float(num_str)
print("The number is " + str(num))
```

## Converting a string input to a boolean:
```python
answer = input("Are you a student? (yes/no): ")
is_student = answer.lower() == "yes"
print("You are a student: " + str(is_student))
```
## Converting a string input to a list of integers:
```python
nums_str = input("Enter a list of numbers separated by commas: ")
nums_list = [int(num) for num in nums_str.split(",")]
print("The list of numbers is " + str(nums_list))
```

# Advanced Input Topics
## Reading input from files:

```python
with open("input.txt") as file:
    lines = file.readlines()
    for line in lines:
        print(line)
```

## Handling errors when reading input:
```python
try:
    num = int(input("Enter a number: "))
    print("The square of the number is " + str(num ** 2))
except ValueError:
    print("Invalid input. Please enter a number.")
```
