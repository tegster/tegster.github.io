## Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming

Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects," which can contain data and code. In Python, everything is an object. OOP focuses on organizing code into classes and objects, making it easier to design, maintain, and scale applications.

## Classes and Objects

## Classes

A class is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines a set of attributes and methods that the objects created from the class will have.
```python
class Dog:
    species = "Canis lupus familiaris"

    def init(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age

    def speak(self, sound):
        print(f"{self.name} says {sound}")

# In this code snippet, we define a Dog class with a 
# class attribute species, an init method 
# (constructor), and a speak method. The init method 
# initializes the instance attributes name and age 
# when a new Dog object is created.
```
## Objects

An object is an instance of a class. You can create multiple objects from a single class, each with its unique set of attributes.
```python
#Creating two Dog objects
dog1 = Dog("Buddy", 3)
dog2 = Dog("Max", 5)

#Accessing object attributes
print(dog1.name)  # Output: Buddy
print(dog2.age)   # Output: 5

#Calling object method
dog1.speak("Woof")  # Output: Buddy says Woof

# Here, we create two Dog objects, dog1 and dog2, 
# with different names and ages. We then access their 
# attributes using the dot notation and call the 
# speak method on dog1.
```
## Inheritance and Polymorphism

##Inheritance

Inheritance allows a class to inherit attributes and methods from another class, promoting code reusability.
```python
class Animal:
    def init(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age

    def speak(self, sound):
        print(f"{self.name} says {sound}")

class Dog(Animal):
    species = "Canis lupus familiaris"

    def bark(self):
        self.speak("Woof")

class Cat(Animal):
    species = "Felis catus"

    def meow(self):
        self.speak("Meow")

# In this example, we have a base class Animal and two 
# derived classes Dog and Cat. Both Dog and Cat inherit the init 
# and speak methods from the Animal class, and each has its own 
# species attribute.
```
## Polymorphism

Polymorphism is the ability of different classes to provide their own implementation of methods with the same name.
```python
dog = Dog("Buddy", 3)
cat = Cat("Misty", 4)

#Using the same method name for different class instances
dog.bark()  # Output: Buddy says Woof
cat.meow()  # Output: Misty says Meow

# Here, both Dog and Cat classes provide their own 
# implementation of the speak method. When we call bark on a 
# Dog object and meow on a Cat object, they output different 
# messages.
```
## Encapsulation

Encapsulation is the practice of hiding the internal details of a class and exposing only what is necessary. This is achieved using private and public attributes and methods.
```python
class BankAccount:
    def init(self, account_number, balance):
        self._account_number = account_number
        self.__balance = balance

    def deposit(self, amount):
        self.__balance += amount

    def withdraw(self, amount):
        if amount <= self.__balance:
            self.__balance -= amount
        else:
            print("Insufficient funds")

    def get_balance(self):
        return self.__balance

# In this example, we define a BankAccount class with private 
# attributes _account_number and __balance. The methods 
# deposit, withdraw, and get_balance are used to manipulate the 
# __balance attribute. By using private attributes and public 
# methods, we ensure that the internal details of the class are 
# not directly accessible from outside.
```
```python
account = BankAccount("123456789", 1000)

#Depositing and withdrawing money
account.deposit(500)
account.withdraw(300)

#Getting the current balance
print(account.get_balance())  # Output: 1200

#Accessing the private attribute will result in an error
print(account.__balance)   # AttributeError: 'BankAccount' object has no attribute '__balance'

#In this code snippet, we create a BankAccount object and 
# interact with it using the public methods deposit, withdraw, 
# and get_balance. Directly accessing the private attribute 
# __balance would raise an error.
```
## Magic Methods and Operator Overloading

Magic methods, also known as dunder (double underscore) methods, allow you to customize the behavior of Python's built-in functions and operators for your classes.

Example: Implementing a Vector Class
```python
class Vector:
    def init(self, x, y):
        self.x = x
        self.y = y

    def repr(self):
        return f"Vector({self.x}, {self.y})"

    def add(self, other):
        return Vector(self.x + other.x, self.y + other.y)

    def sub(self, other):
        return Vector(self.x - other.x, self.y - other.y)

#In this example, we define a Vector class with magic methods 
# repr, add, and sub. The repr method returns a string 
# representation of the object, while add and sub implement the 
# addition and subtraction operators, respectively.
```
```python
v1 = Vector(2, 3)
v2 = Vector(4, 5)

# String representation of a vector
print(v1)  # Output: Vector(2, 3)

# Vector addition and subtraction
print(v1 + v2)  # Output: Vector(6, 8)
print(v1 - v2)  # Output: Vector(-2, -2)

# Here, we create two Vector objects and perform addition and 
# subtraction using the overloaded + and - operators. The repr 
# method provides a human-readable string representation of the 
# vector objects.
```
In conclusion, mastering object-oriented programming in Python involves understanding classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and magic methods.
