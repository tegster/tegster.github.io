# Python Basics: Variables and Data Types

## Introduction
In this blog post, we'll explore the fundamentals of Python programming, including variables, data types, operators, expressions, strings, and user input/output. Understanding these basics is essential for anyone starting their journey with Python. Let's dive in!

# Variables and Data Types
Variables are containers for storing data values. In Python, you don't need to declare a variable's data type; the interpreter automatically detects it based on the assigned value.

## Assigning values to variables
```python
x = 10          # Integer
name = "John"   # String
is_active = True # Boolean
```
## Data Types
Python has several built-in data types, such as integers, floats, strings, and booleans.

- ***Integers*** are whole numbers, positive or negative.
- ***Floats*** are numbers with a decimal point or an exponent that can represent very large or very small values. 
- ***Strings*** are sequences of characters, such as letters, numbers, and symbols, that are enclosed in quotation marks.
- ***Booleans*** are binary values that can be either true or false. 
## Assigning values to variables
```python
x = 10       # Integer - a whole number, no decimals
pi = 3.14    # Floats - Decimal number   
name = "John"   # String
is_active = True # Boolean
```
## Advanced Data Types
## Lists
Lists can be any ordered collections of data, such as [1, 2, 3], ["apple", "banana", "orange"], and [1, "hello", True]. Think of your grocery List, instead of just visiting the grocery store, maybe you write 'I need to say Hello to one person', now that's an item in your list.

```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange"]
```

## Tuples
Immutable ordered collections of data, similar to lists but cannot be changed once created, such as (1, 2, 3), ("apple", "banana", "orange"), and (1, "hello", True). Imagine lists but tuples cannot be changed.

```python
person = ("John", 30, "male")
point = (1, 2)
```

## Dictionaries
Dictionaries are Unordered collections of key-value pairs, such as {"name": "John", "age": 30}, {"fruit": "apple", "color": "red"}, and {"is_raining": True, "temperature": 20}.

Imagine, a whole variable and its value, stored in a list. variable is the key and Value is the value of the variable

```python
person = {"name": "John", "age": 30, "gender": "male"}
fruit_colors = {"apple": "red", "banana": "yellow", "orange": "orange"}
```



# Basic Operators and Expressions
Python provides various operators for performing arithmetic, comparison, and logical operations.

```python
#Arithmetic Operators
a = 7
b = 3

addition = a + b         # 10
subtraction = a - b      # 4
multiplication = a * b   # 21
division = a / b         # 2.3333
floor_division = a // b  # 2
modulo = a % b           # 1
exponentiation = a ** b  # 343

#Comparison Operators
a = 5
b = 7

equal = a == b       # False
not_equal = a != b   # True
greater_than = a > b # False
less_than = a < b    # True


#Logical Operators
a = True
b = False

and_operator = a and b # False
or_operator = a or b   # True
not_operator = not a   # False
```
# Strings and String Manipulation
Strings are sequences of characters, enclosed in single or double quotes. You can perform various operations on strings, such as concatenation, slicing, and formatting.

```python
# Creating strings
string1 = "Hello"
string2 = 'World'

# Concatenating strings
greeting = string1 + ", " + string2 + "!" # "Hello, World!"

# Slicing strings
substring = greeting[0:5] # "Hello"

# String formatting
name = "Alice"
age = 30
formatted_string = f"My name is {name} and I am {age} years old."
```
# User Input and Output
Python allows you to interact with users through input and output operations. You can use the input() function to get user input and the print() function to display output.

```python
#Getting user input
name = input("Please enter your name: ")

#Displaying output
print(f"Hello, {name}!")

#Combining input and output
age = int(input("Please enter your age: "))
print(f"Next year, you'll be {age + 1} years old.")
```
# Conclusion
In this blog post, we've covered the basics of Python programming, including variables, data types, operators, expressions, strings, and user input/output. Mastering these fundamentals will set a strong foundation for your Python learning journey. As you continue to explore Python, you'll encounter more advanced topics like control structures, loops, functions, and data structures. Keep practicing and experimenting with different concepts to become a confident Python programmer. Happy coding!
